## [Unreleased] — 2.0.0

A ground-up rewrite. Version 1 was an internal service tied to one product; version 2
is a general-purpose, self-hosted notification orchestrator.

### Added
- Event ingestion with idempotency keys and inline recipient profiles.
- Rules: JSON Logic conditions, wildcard event names, priorities, `stop_processing`,
  delays, cooldowns and deterministic percentage rollouts, plus a dry-run endpoint.
- Categories carrying delivery policy: rolling frequency caps, quiet hours and
  unsubscribe rules. `transactional` and `marketing` are created by default.
- Localised Jinja2 templates (sandboxed, strict) with per-channel overrides, versioning
  and a preview endpoint.
- Channels: Firebase Cloud Messaging, Twilio SMS, SMTP e-mail, Telegram, signed
  webhooks and a console channel; third-party channels via entry points.
- Multi-address delivery, channel fallback, retry with backoff and automatic disabling
  of dead addresses.
- Broadcasts with resumable batches, pause/resume/cancel and audience filters.
- Optional AI copy personalisation through Pydantic AI (any provider) with fact
  guardrails, allow-listed context and a daily token budget.
- Delivery and engagement tracking, including a token-based endpoint for client apps.
- Scoped API keys, RFC 9457 problem responses, cursor pagination, Prometheus metrics.
- Hardening: SSRF-safe per-recipient webhooks, resource-bounded template sandbox and
  rule evaluator, race-free cancellation, job lease heartbeats, and failure states for
  events, messages and broadcasts whose jobs exhaust their retries.
- A transactional, database-backed job queue (no Redis required).
- `cue` CLI: `serve`, `worker`, `db`, `keys`, `jobs`, `prune`, `check`, `mcp`.
- A Model Context Protocol server so AI agents can send notifications and inspect
  delivery with scoped API keys.

### Removed
- The v1 Piccolo/Dramatiq/APScheduler stack, product-specific triggers and the
  Kubernetes deployment of the original product.
